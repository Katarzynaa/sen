## SEN - Description
SEN is a novel publicly available human-labelled dataset for training and testing machine learning algorithms for the problem of entity level sentiment analysis of political news headlines.

On-line news portals play a very important role in the information society. Fair media should present reliable and objective information. In practice there is an observable positive or negative bias concerning named entities (e.g. politicians) mentioned in the on-line news headlines.
Our dataset consists of 3819 human-labelled political news headlines coming from several major on-line media outlets in English and Polish.
